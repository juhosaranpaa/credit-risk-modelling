# credit-risk-modelling
Credit Risk Modeling project using Python and machine learning techniques to predict loan default probabilities. Implements decision trees and SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets, with model evaluation using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores. Designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate data science and machine learning skills in financial risk assessment. This was done as part of a data science master's course at Aalto University and enhanced for showcase purposes.
